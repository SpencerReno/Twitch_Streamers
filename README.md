# Twitch Streamers 
Data for this project was pulled from [StreamChart's](https://streamscharts.com/) Api and [Twitch's](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/) Api. This Projects main goal is to compare streamers, and other twitch data on a weekly basis to see growth and decline on the website. In a previous project I mainly focused on just the directories and games. Here, this is to mainly compare the streamers. There will be some overlap with graphs showing data on the directories but that is to show the current Twitch "Meta"(The current popular trend to follow) that streamers are following to stay relevent and or on top.
